# HPC 101: Profiling

Demo repository for an introduction to HPC lesson on profiling.

## Overview

This repository contains practical examples and demonstrations for learning about profiling techniques in high-performance computing (HPC) applications. The examples are designed to help you understand how to identify performance bottlenecks, analyze code efficiency, and optimize computational workloads.

## Repository Structure

- **python-examples/**: Python profiling demonstrations
- **JuliaExamples/**: Julia profiling demonstrations

## Topics Covered

- CPU profiling and performance analysis
- Memory profiling and optimization
- Identifying computational bottlenecks
- Best practices for HPC code optimization
- Hands-on profiling tool usage

## Getting Started

Explore the language-specific directories to find examples and exercises for profiling in Python and Julia. Each directory contains its own README with more detailed instructions.
